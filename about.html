	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>This page is about Josh, Ricky, and one of the Chris's. They are the cool people. Cooler than Triscuits. Too cool for beanbag chairs. So cool that the triangles on the wall change colors. Josh, Ricky, and that one Chris nearly counterbalance the hotness from the whiteboard, since it keeps peeling off the wall forming unsightly bubbles. Cool enough that TIY doesn't need the AC on. So cool that the sun retreats from the skylight and we have to keep the lights on.</p>
	<h4>Josh was once kicked out of Russia for being too cool
</h4>
<h4>Ricky was denied a fair trial in 2007 for being too cool</h4>
<h4>Chris's birth name was Coolenstag Von Coolerstein but that was legally too cool, so the government made his parents change it</h4>
